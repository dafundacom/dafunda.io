Separate imports from npm and components made in the project to make it more
readable and easy to fix if there are errors.

Correct:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Image from "next/image"
import Link from "next/link"

import { Button } from "@/components/Button"
import { Navigation } from "@/components/Navigation"
import { Footer } from "@/components/Footer"
```

Incorrect:

```jsx
import { Navigation } from "@/components/Navigation"
import React from "react"
import Image from "next/image"
import { Footer } from "@/components/Footer"
import Link from "next/link"
import { Button } from "@/components/Button"
```
